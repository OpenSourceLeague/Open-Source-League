# Open Source League 

The Open Source League was created on Friday, July 12, 2019 to motivate anyone to contribute to an open source project every week.

## How It Works

1. Every Sunday, an open source project will be chosen **randomly**.
2. Understand the project, its features, the problems it answers.
3. Contribute to the project (propose features, making issues, become a contributor)
4. List your contributions at the end of the week (Sunday)

## Add your contributions

First, take a look at the `contributions.md` file inside the first demo projet.
You can put your contributions to the `contributions.md` by adding your username (list) and your contributions (sub-list) in the list, if it's empty just create it:

1. [username] 
   * [Bug] input disapear in form... 

Use the issues labels system for your contributions:

1. [Bug] - Something isn't working
2. [Documentation] Impromevents or additions to documentation
3. [Duplicate] This issue or pull request already exists
4. [Enhancement] New feature or request
5. [Good first issue] Good for newcomers
6. [Help wanted] Extra attention is needed
7. [Invalid] This doesn't seem right
8. [Question] Further information is requested
9. [Wontfix] This will not be worked on
10. [Other] Become a contributor to the project

Create a new branch `contributions/[username]` and make a pull request !
That's it ! You can now be part of the Open Source League

Have fun !
